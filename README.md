## Background and Overview

This project is a data visualization of the Olympic medals won around the world for the 2021 Tokyo Olympic games. Countries that have won more medals will be colored darker than those with less medals. Users will be able to hover over a country to see the amount of gold, silver, and bronze medals that country has won. Additionally, users will be able to click on a country to see both the medal distribution and athelete(s) participating for that country.

## Functionality & MVPs
In this data visualization, users will be able to:
* Distinguish the highest medal earning countries without mouse movement.
* Hover over countries to display the models won.
* Click on countries to display a detailed breakdown of medals, athletes, and events.
* Toggle between a countries medal count and the global medal breakdown.

In addition, this project will include:
* Links to LinkedIn,Github, and personal site
* A production README
